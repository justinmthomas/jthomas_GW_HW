    "The analysis shows that students attending charter schools in general have better grades on both math and reading.  The students attending charter schools get better grades but the charter schools also spend less per student.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also tell that larger schools have a much lower pass rate and that the amount of money spent per student does not correlate with better grades. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see that the difference between passing rates is far higher between charter schools and district schools than the difference between average test scores which indicates that the scores may be impacted by outliers or other issues that are impacting passing rates more than actual test scores.
